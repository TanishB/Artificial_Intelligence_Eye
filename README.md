## Face_off.py
Make sure you have 4 folders in your directory<br>

When you run this file every new face encountered within 1 minute will be saved to Faces folder and one minute video will be generated recursively in the Vids folder. Saving takes place according to the DateTime format

## Backtrack.py
Along with Faces and Vids, you should also have these two folders in your directory<br>
-> Tracker<br>
-> Result<br>
This file runs under a infinite loop. It helps you to find out the video of a particular face. What you need to do is just run this file and then go to your directory copy a face image and move to Tracker folder and then open the results folder to where you'll find the desired video.
